# Tech Stack
## Frontend
### React Native
<https://reactnative.dev/>
- Using React Native allows us to write code once and be able to have our app display on both Android and IOS.
- React native provides a near native performace by compiling to native components, which allows for s smooth interactive experience.
- React Native has a lot of support and is continuing to grow and improve.
- We will also be using expo framework for the use of its components since it makes things easier like expo-video instead of using react-native-video
## Backend
### Firebase
<https://firebase.google.com/>
- Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service which will handle user authentication, 
database, and analytics which is great for our app.
## Database
### Firestore
<https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore>
- Firestore is apart of firebase but the main reason for using this is the instant update to the database. This will allow questions to show up instantly and games to show up as well.

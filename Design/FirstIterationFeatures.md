# First Iteration Features
## Focus on Group Mode
- Users will be able to create multiple groups (high)
- There will be a code that restricts access to the group (high)
- Group admin selects which game the group will watch (high)
- There is a separate group leaderboard (medium)
- Each group needs to have at least one co-admin (medium)
- Group admin can kick players (low)

## Explanation
The reason we decided to start with implementing group mode was from all the feedback of wanting group mode to be accessible in the app. We do have a basic group mode but is currently not up to date so that is why this is a great first feature. Currently in the app you can create a group but thats really all you can do. So with implementing this feature, you will be able to start creating groups with other people, watch the game, answer questions, compete with friends, and other groups.

# First Iteration Features
## Focus on Group Mode
- Users will be able to create multiple groups (high)
- There will be a code that restricts access to the group (high)
- Group admin selects which game the group will watch (high)
- There is a separate group leaderboard (medium)
- Each group needs to have at least one co-admin (medium)
- Group admin can kick players (low)

## Explanation
We decided to start with Group Mode because it’s one of the features users have been asking for the most. While a very basic version of Group Mode exists in the app, it’s outdated and limited with only being able to create a group at this point.

With this first iteration, users will finally be able to:
- Create groups with friends
- Join games and watch them together
- Answer questions in real time
- Compete against each other and other groups.

This is also a great feature since we have limited time to complete iteration 1 and allows us to focus on the feature while just fixing minimal things from previous updates.

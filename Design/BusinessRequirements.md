# Business Requirements
## BR1: 
The app will utilize a low latency live feed of American football games as well as utilize past American football games, and allow users to make predictions on said feed.

This is required as it is the core objective of the app, to provide an extra service on top of the game to enhance the viewing experience. Low latency will provide fairness to the app and enchances the user experience.
## BR2:
The app will have a gamified aspect, containing world leaderboards, local and world-level competition, powerups, and real life rewards, with an emphasis on fun.

The app needs to be "fun", as it has to be shown to investors who find the concept worth putting money into, so gamified aspects are key to its success. They must be intuitive to understand and add to the prediction making aspect of the game, allowing for users to feel they have a fair chance against others. Rewards given include real discounts on services to entice users to stay with the app.

# Project Description
Play-By-Play is a football prediction app that lets you test your football prediction instincts in real time. Each correct prediction allows you to climb leaderboard and you earn points and rewards. Power ups will also allow you to climb and pass other players on the leaderboard to increase your chances of getting better rewards. Rewards range from coupons to gift cards, with higher leaderboard positions unlocking better rewards. You can also compete with friends in groups, earning points both for yourself and your team. A feature that the company wants added is to have groups face off against each other during games.

- Predictions go out at real time and can be answered.

- App should be smooth and have reduce lag.
- Code should be modular to allow for reuse of components and easy to update.

## Constraints
- video synchronization must work even with poor internet connection.
- Must be able to run on IOS and Android.
- Ensure code is not making unnecessary read/write to our database to ensure speed and performance.
